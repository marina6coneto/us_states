# USA States Game

- This project is a game to help you learn the states of USA. 
- The goal is to correctly identify all the states on the map.

## Day 25 Project

This project is from Day 25 of the course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" by Angela Yu.

## Overview

- The USA States Game uses Python's `turtle` graphics module to display a map of USA and `pandas` to handle data.
- The game prompts the user to input the names of American states and places the names on the map if they are correct.
- If the user types "Exit", the game ends and saves the states that were not guessed to a CSV file.

## Requirements

- Python 
- turtle module
- pandas module


## How to Run the Project

1. Ensure you have the map image (`blank_states_img.gif`) and the CSV file (`50_states.csv`) in the same directory as your script.
2. Run the script using Python:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
3. The game window will open with the map of USA.
4. Input the name of the states in the prompt that appears. If you wish to stop the game, type "Exit".
5. If you type "Exit," a CSV file named `states_to_learn.csv` will be created with the names of the states you didn't guess correctly.

### Enjoy the game and improve your knowledge of the states of USA!
